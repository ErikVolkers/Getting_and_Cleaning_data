# Getting_and_Cleaning_data

# This repository contains four files:
## 1. An R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

### - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
### - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
### - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
### - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
### - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## 2. The resulting file: tidydata.csv

## 3. The codebook to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

## 4. This README file
